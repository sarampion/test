    <h3 id="headline"> A brief story of the beginning of Nurse Schuesky </h3> 
     <p> Eleonor P. Schuesky was born in a small town at the outskirts of Kignhelburg in September of 1923. She is best known as one of the main reasons many people affected in the 1965 war in Kignhelburg against the Kaushtian invasion were able to receive medicine, food, and care in one of the biggest hospitals in the country. Eleonor grew up in Yielder along with her three siblings and mother. Her father suffered from a rare disease and later succumbed to it at the age of fifty-seven. She began her career in medicine at the age of seventeen when she accepted a volunteer position at the local hospital in the town of Yielder, studying and later teaching at the same place until eventually being sent to the Fhennel Hospital in the capital of Kignhelburg, where she later became the head nurse.</p>

<p>Since Kignhelburg was under threat from its neighboring country, most of the budget destined to alleviate the pressure from the health sectors, given the attacks, was used instead to fund the constant need for armory and protection in the southern border of Kignhelburg. Facing new strains, the administration of Fhennel Hospital was forced to ration medicine, food, and energy, leaving hundreds of patients and part of the staff abandoned.</p>

<p>Devastated by the current state of the hospital, Eleonor, with the help of her devoted partner Millicent Photcher, relied on support from unlikely sources such as underground links operating illegally in the country and even resorted to blackmailing important figures in the Kignhelburg political party to secure the supplies their patients and staff desperately needed.</p>

 <figcaption id="img-caption">One of the diaries along with one of the letter found hidden in  Fhennel Hospital </figcaption></div>
   <p> Eleonore met Millicent during her first years at the Fhennel Hospital, and their enduring relationship lasted until Eleonore's passing. With Millicent's assistance, Schuesky established connections with the underground networks operating in the country at the time. While the certainty of the system they created is yet to be proven, multiple letters and writings found in both of their journals suggest its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Thanks to Schuesky's influential connections with the political branch in Kignhelburg, she often utilized personal information on key figures as leverage, receiving monetary compensation to secure her silence. This money was later directed to the underground groups controlling medicine distribution in Kignhelburg, a domain primarily overseen by Millicent. Her involvement with one of the nurses in this group, during the early stages of her medical career, granted her control and influence within this critical aspect of the system.</p>

<p>It was estimated that thanks to the intricate system developed by both Schuesky and Photcher saved around three thousand lives. The tenacity and recklessness displayed by the two nurses to rescue the hospital during the war were not well-received by many of the ruling families in Kignhelburg. It was due to the secrets held by these families and their fear of public derision that the hospital managed to resurface. After the war, relentless pursuit by these families aimed to bring down Schuesky, even resorting to using her personal life against her, ultimately forcing her to escape to Sweden to avoid criminal charges. Rumors circulated that years later, Millicent flew to the city where Eleonore had taken shelter, and the two finally settled to have a quiet life together.</p>
  
  <p>This was later confirmed by an extract from a letter found during the investigation into Schuesky's life:</p>

<p id="quote1">"Dear Angel, last Saturday I saw one of the mayor's counselors talking to Marcus, it won't be long for him to start asking for my head, after all, your name is synonymous with mine. Poor Marcus was one of the few partners that kept me company in your absence, and I will miss him greatly."
  </p>

<p>Daniel Khujhel, the son of one of Eleonore's nieces was recently able to confirm the veracity of the fact. Stating how both nurses led a quiet life in Sweden until the eventual passing of Eleonore in 2016. </p>

<h3> Legacy </h3>

<p> In 2002 the Charitable Foundation "Schuesky's Angels" was founded by her nephews, Daniel and Anton Khujhel, with the purpose of helping thousands of children, women and elders in need of medical treatment. 
  
  <p>A true example of tenacity for everyone around this time. </p>
